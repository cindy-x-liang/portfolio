    <p class="project-description">
      Cornell students seek to conveniently sell and purchase second-hand items necessary for college life. 
      Currently this occurs through the annual dump and run or through Facebook marketplace.
       Issues with this current model include scammers and lack of trust on Facebook marketplace, and the annual dump and run only occurring once a year. 
       <br>
       <br>

       The solution is to develop an app just for Cornell students to conveniently buy and sell items to other students. 
       Students can act as both sellers and buyers on the app, and purchase an item through a secure chat feature.
        We have surpassed over 400 users within 1 year of launch and continue to see growth in users, especially with the development of new features.
