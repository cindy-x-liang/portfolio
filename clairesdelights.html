      This website built in React displays an animated homepage, followed by a shopping page, cart
      page, checkout page, and return to shopping page.
      <br>
      Users are able to add items from the shopping page into their cart and in turn increase and
      decrease items in the cart as well.
      <br>
      The cart is also reflected in the checkout page and Email.js is used to send order requests.
