    <p class="project-description">
        Bus and walking routes around Cornell’s campus can be difficult to navigate for students. 
        Further, bus route schedules can be unreliable due to delays and road closures. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Ithaca Transit provides a simple, intuitive UI for Cornell students to easily access and find different bus and walking routes to navigate around Cornell and Ithaca. 
        We pull transit data directly from TCAT to ensure that the delay information and route location data we receive is the most reliable and up to date. 
        We have over 800 users using the app, and several Cornell students depend on Transit to get to their classes and participate in on-campus activities.
