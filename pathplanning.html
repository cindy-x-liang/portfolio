      <br>
                    The Path Planning project was completed with the project team CUAir at Cornell.
                    <br>
                    The purpose of the project was to help guide the aircraft to complete its 'airdrop' task.
                    The plane must fly to 2 designated target locations to drop a water bottle and stay within
                    competition boundaries in order to successfully complete this task.
                    <br>
                    For this project, I used Python to help develop an algorithm for how the plane would reach
                    the target locations. This algorithm would choose waypoints that the plane would fly to that
                    ensured the plane would stay within boundaries and reach the correct location.
