    <p class="project-description">
      The purpose of this app was to aid in the trip planning process. Users can input travel location, date, purpose, and length of stay through an initial input screen. 
      If users are unsure about where they are traveling, they can also choose to chat with an AI agent to receive location recommendations. 
      The user will then move onto the chat page where they will receive an initial travel itinerary and have the option to chat with the agent to edit their itinerary.
<br>
<br>

When they are finished, they can view their itinerary on a final itinerary page. 
This page will also be stored in the app's "itinerary history" so users can refer to old itineraries if they like.
The user will receive flight and hotel suggestions as well on the final itinerary page, which is received from a Flask app that integrates a customized LangChain agent that I built.
 The app uses HTTP requests to get the necessary information.

            <figcaption style="width:800px;" >In the video demo, I step through how a user could use the various functionalities in our travel app. Upon opening the app, users can choose to generate a new itinerary. This is where users would indicate
                their travel preference, length of travel, etc. and in turn receive an itinerary result where they will chat with an intelligent travel agent to edit/make changes. Afterwards, they 
                will see their finalized itinerary as well as hotel and flight suggestions. Users also have the choice to chat with the agent for destination suggestions if they don't even know where they want to
                travel to begin with. They can also see all the past itineraries they have constructed.
